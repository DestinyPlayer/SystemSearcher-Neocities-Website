            Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Whatever can be captured in words can be conquered with understanding. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether?

            Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. Don’t fucking censor yourself. Sterility leads to susceptibility.

            What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. You are not your fucking work. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. Be fucking impossible to ignore. Stand so tall that they can’t look past you. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. You’ve been placed in the crucial moment. Abandon the shelter of insecurity. Accomplishment validates belief, and belief inspires accomplishment. Don’t fucking censor yourself. Sterility leads to susceptibility.

            Don’t fucking censor yourself. Sterility leads to susceptibility. Don’t fucking lie to yourself. Creativity requires fucking tenacity. Most of your accomplishments will be demonstrations of tenacity, not talent. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Respect your fucking craft.

            Be fucking impossible to ignore. Stand so tall that they can’t look past you. Fuck. Creativity requires fucking tenacity. Most of your accomplishments will be demonstrations of tenacity, not talent. Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” Don’t fucking censor yourself. Sterility leads to susceptibility. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. There is no right fucking answer. The splendor of the mystery is that you don’t understand. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space.
