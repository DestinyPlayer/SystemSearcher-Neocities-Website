          <p class="textline">Nords are commonly thought to be descended from something powerful. Some say that they are descended from giants, being an evolutionary offshoot. Some even take the whole "Dragonborn" thing even more seriously than most and say that all Nords are descended from Dragons. Some even go to say that they are distantly related to the infamous bears of Skyrim.</p>
          
          <p class="textline">The truth remains a closely guarded secret by any scholar who learns of this. It is not something that is researched too deeply, due to obvious reasons, but biologists have discovered that Nords have a rather uncomfortable amount of similarities with another beast very, very common in Skyrim. One that is known for its boundless territorialism, aggression to anything that's not their own kind, and also for prodigious beards.</p>
          
          <p class="textline">It turns out that Nords might have evolved from Horkers.</p>

          <p class="textline">The Bishops and The One who Waits are all ascended mortals. The real gods are the crowns.</p>
  
          <p class="textline">When we see the various statues of the old gods, the Money God, the statues around Haro, and sometimes just statues of them in random levels, they always have a much, much more unified appearance than the Bishops. One with a two-peaked head, lots of tentacles, and a large smile. While the last two parts do not truly fit, the overall shape makes me think of one thing... the Crowns.</p>
  
          <p class="textline">What if the Bishops are, in truth, merely ascended mortals, like the Lamb? Meanwhile the true power, the actual deities, are the crowns? Perhaps they are all that remains of the gods of old, mere symbiotes, using mortal hosts in order to ensure their survival in an age of constant deicide. Even if their mortal hosts die, the crowns survive, get claimed by another, and continue as if nothing happens, because they do not truly need to be the objects of worship, merely drink up the devotion towards another.</p>

          <p class="textline">Justice is actually God in disguise. He/She/They/Whatever realized what a fuck up they were during the Old Testament (which wasn’t quite correctly written down in the Bible in the first place so it’s even more complicated a situation than it already is).</p>
          
          <p class="textline">And so, by the time of the New Testament, she’d long since retired and fucked off from heaven, leaving it entirely in the angels’ control, all in order to try and reconnect with her lost daughter, at least in some way, via pretending to be a demon and becoming her friend.</p>
          
          <p class="textline">Magnificent, omnipotent cosmic power, all of it used just to be awesome and cook good apple pies. At this point she wouldn’t go back even if the rest of the angels begged.</p>

          <p class="textline"> It feels kind of weird how Malina is the only one who bothers with painting her nails when everybody else doesn't, not even Lucifer. Well, the truth is actually exactly the opposite. Demon nails are naturally solid black, and it's fashionable to make them the color of either your skin or ordinary human nails. Malina is basically the only one who doesn't bother.</p>

          <p class="textline">Neither the actual Toa Metru nor the “supposed correct” Toa Metru were actually destinied for greatness. What nobody, absolutely nobody, not even Teridax knows is that Mata Nui didn’t choose them for any great purpose. It is well known that, until everything happened, Mata Nui didn’t actually pay that much attention to his insides, so he didn’t actually give that much thought to the whole thing.</p>
          
          <p class="textline">No, he just picked two sets of Matoran at random and then flipped them to confuse Teridax. At best, he picked the Matoran who just so happened to know the location of the Great Disks for convenience and then randomly picked a few other Matoran they were close to.</p>
          
          <p class="textline">The Toa Metru were the world’s luckiest flip of the coin.</p>

          <p class="textline">Upon becoming a Turaga, Takanuva did not quiet down any. He gained the Wisdom that all Turaga seemingly get uploaded into them, but that did nothing to dial down his adventuring/pranking spirit. No, all it did was teach him how to get away with it.</p>
  
          <p class="textline">He’s now on a permanent vacation where he just spelunks in every single old ruin, abandoned archive section or Glatorian tomb he bumps into. His only companions being Pewku and (sometimes) Whenua if he finds something particularly historically interesting.</p>
          
          <p class="textline">He’s basically Indiana Jones with a lightbulb for a head.</p>

          <p class="textline">There are a few species in the Matoran universe besides the Matoran themselves who are dependent on unpowered Kanohi for function, meanwhile quite a lot of others don't.</p>

          <p class="textline">I have a theory that they require two sources of energy to function properly. The stuff that is required for the organic components, and the stuff that is required for the synthetic components. One they get by absorbing it from food, meanwhile the other, is either gained from an internal power supply that very rarely needs refueling, or from a mask.</p>

          <p class="textline">Thing is, Matoran are just too goddamn small. The Great Beings couldn't fit the proper internal power supply without ruining the maintenance-bot-that-can-get-everywhere part of the Matoran, as such, they designed the Kanohi system to serve as an external power supply. They then added onto that system when they realized that it also serves as an excellent conduit for extra powers.</p>

          <p class="textline">Now what about other species? Ones that are obviously much larger than Matoran, but still either use or even require Kanohi masks to function?</p>

          <p class="textline">They were designed off of the basic Matoran template. The Great Beings were using them to lower the amount of work required, only to then realize that the final entity would have to be much larger than a Matoran to pull off the other functions they wanted them to have, but they also REALLY didn't want to rewire the entire synthetic power supply system and so just kept it in and blew it up, perhaps upgrading it for full Kanohi use so that it doesn't seem like a pointless limitation.</p>

          <p class="textline">So basically, the Great Beings were lazy and ended up in a situation where they either had to half-ass things or do double the amount of work. And, as any tinkerer will tell you, in such situations you always end up half-assing and promising yourself that next time you'll do it properly.</p>

          <p class="textline">Reimu is actually very, very much aware of the identity of the Hakurei god. Because it is actually her. After the death of the last Hakurei maiden, there was no heir left, so as a result the Hakurei Kami has actually come down and manifest herself, as Reimu.</p>
            
          <p class="textline">This is why she treats everybody the same, and why she's so lazy and grumpy about doing her job (because normally other people are supposed to do so), as well as why she is so cheaty in many ways.</p>
            
          <p class="textline">That's also why she used to have purple hair at first. She didn't quite nail down "looking like a normal human" until a few years into the future.</p>

          <p class="textline">The true reason why Vergil went “My son means nothing to me!” isn’t actually a mistranslation from Japanese. It’s just that Vergil naturally gravitates to being a drama queen whenever he’s confused or overall not sure what to say, and so he went for the most dramatic possible way to phrase the meaning of “When the hell did I get a son?!”, to the point that the meaning got corrupted.</p>

          <p class="textline">Latinum isn't actually non-replicatable. It's just that in its natural form it has an incredibly chaotic molecular structure, to the point that it is literally impossible for it to be accurately made artificially, as it would have patterns, no matter how hard to decypther they would be.</p>
            
          <p class="textline">The Ferengi have got the definition of "pure enough Latinum" so damn precise that sometimes some natural ore deposits get denied as being too orderly.</p>
