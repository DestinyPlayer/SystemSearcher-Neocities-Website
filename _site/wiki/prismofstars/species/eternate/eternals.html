				<b>Aet</b> (pronounced Ah-ett), also colloquially known as <b>Eternals</b> due to the sheer length of their lifespans, are a highly technologically advanced nanomachine-based species whose unique biology has lead to a rather peculiar combination of traits, both biologically and culturally.
			</p>
			<p>
				With their rather individualistic culture, though mixed in a somewhat bizarre way with a collective mindset, they have never really accepted or tolerated authority. This, alongside their rather commonly irreverent nature, tends to cause friction when it comes to interacting with other cultures.
			</p>
			<p>
				Completely lacking a natural connection to <a href="#" class="redlink">the Void</a>, Aet have instead ended up on a near-completely technological base of knowledge, assisted by their nanomachine biosphere, allowing for much greater and simpler construction methods than most cultures had access to early in their advancement.
			</p>
			<p>
				Said limitations, however, did not prevent them from making use of <a href="#" class="redlink">the Void</a>. Through scientific exchange with other species and extensive reverse engineering of <a href="#" class="redlink">Invader</a> technology, they have managed to figure out an artificial method of tapping into <a href="#" class="redlink">the Void</a>.

			<h2 id="head1">Attributes</h2>


			<h3 id="sect1">Biology</h3>

			<p>
				Evolved on a planet that was an experiment by some precursor species, where they seeded it with nanomachines to see how an entirely nanomech biosphere would form up.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the biological peculiarities of the Eternates is that their "hand" equivalent, alongside most macro-scale manipulation organs on their planet, are closer to a clump of nanomachines that reshape themselves into required/desired shape for the task at hand rather than being a singular shape.
			</p>
			<p>
				In its natural form, this organ is too generalized to allow for active and intentional reshaping and so can only alter its shape to grip anything it tries to grip firmly, however with advances of science, they have managed to figure out how to gain much better control over it and so can reshape the clumps into specific tools and, when necessary, even straight up a hand.
			</p>

			<h3 id="sect2">Culture</h3>

			<p>
				Are basically constantly connected via a species-vide mental network connection, which permits for a complete digital democracy and endless memeage.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not quite a hivemind, not quite singular either.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to their biological quirks, they ended up as a rather bizarre mix of highly individualist and yet rather collective-minded.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eternates have trouble fully understanding the other species' need for privacy. They've all been connected to a single, massive mental network since before they figured out civilization, even if back then it was much more rudimentary, and so they basically formed a society where privacy barely existed since the very onset
			</p>

			<h3 id="sect2">Technology</h3>
			<p>
				Basically no capacity for magic, borderline commander-tier technology.
			</p>

			<h2 id="head2">Historical events</h2>
			<p>
				Recently fought in a war where they were caught completely unprepared, yet managed to retreat to their home system and reinforce it within days to the point that the invaders' fleets shattered against it and they then proceeded to counterattack.
			</p>
			<p>
				Extremely smug about that event.
