          Greetings, visitor. My name of choice, as stated prior, is System Searcher. I go by many other names, but here and now, that is who you will know me as. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
        </p>
        <p class="textline">
          I am but a mere inhabitant of the internet, same as you are. And with this web page, I am now in possession of a small area that I can truly call my own. Coded in naught but plain HTML, CSS and Javascript, this website has been a labor of love and passion, having even me up until late into the night and day on certain occasions. Which, admittedly, did not help my disposition or mental state at the time, but, well... it is now in the past.
        </p>

          Besides web design, I am also interested in vector art in various forms, ranging from graphics design to general character art, as well as 3D modeling and animation, more general coding, pixel art, modding, Live2D model creation, writing, worldbuilding, mapmaking and... well. It is much easier to say that I am, overall, a dabbler. I have tried my hand at nearly every form of digital art out there, and have found myself reaching an at least middling level os skill at it. 
        </p>
        <p class="textline">
          It is both my strong point, my ability to gain a decent level of competency at practically anything I put my hand upon, and my weak point, as well as being something of a curse. After all, I am interested in anything. My art encompasses almost everything. I am not limited, but I am also scattered, spread thin.
        </p>
        <p class="textline">
          Unlimited potential. Limited time, effort and strength of mind.
        </p>

        <p class="textline">
          Aside from my art escapades, I am also interested in many things. I read, and sometimes write, fanfiction of all sorts of settings. Due to my current situation, I tend to favor more lighthearted stories, though I do have a certain appreciation of tales of melancholy. Ones telling of a world that is not aflame with conflict, but merely flickering down into embers.

          I play video games, occasionally. Mostly sandbox games these days, as my mind does not have the strength to dedicate itself to a storyline, along with my general preference of doing things at my own pace, sometimes frantic, sometimes slow and measured. The main exception is the Dark Souls series, especially the first game. Lordran is my home, a place I can look at and see familiarity instead of the chaos and ruin. And, alas, I am also rather terrible at the Souls series. But home is home, is it not?
        </p>

        <p class="textline">
          When it comes to music, I listen to all sorts of things. Soundtracks for various forms of media, heavy and power metal, rock, techno and other electric music, anime soundtracks, some ska, and honestly much, much more. It all depends on the mood that I am found in at the time. There is even some rap and death metal that I enjoy, though I am generally averse to those genres.
        </p>

        <p class="textline">
          Ultimately, I am noone of much importance, except for those for whom I am. Friends, sometimes colleagues, sometimes family. All people I care about, and all people that care about me, to various degrees. I do hope, even if you do not join the list of such people, that you have enjoyed reading this small hill of text that this small excourse into the nature of an entity known as me, myself and I.
        </p>
        <p class="textline">
          And if you did not, then you have the sincerest apologies I am capable of delivering. For all my strength, I have yet to discover a way to turn back time for myself, much less anybody else. I will be sure to notify you if I do achieve this long-standing goal of mine, so that you may reclaim the time you have lost.
